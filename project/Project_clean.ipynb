    "Have you ever wondered why roulette is one of the most iconic casino games in the western hemisphere? While luck and chance undeniably play a major role in determining success, is that really the whole story? What if players could strategically influence their winnings by adjusting how much they bet each round and deciding when to make changes? Perhaps roulette isn't purely a game of chance after all. In this blog post we try to answer these questions."

In all cases, the player begins with a base bet of `$10`, adapting subsequent bets according to the chosen strategy. For the *no strategy* baseline, the player bets a random amount between `$5` and `$20` each round. Additionally, no limit is imposed on the player’s total capital during these simulations."
